# Instaboom

**Everything explodes: blocks, mobs, items, actions. The longer you survive, the more unstable the world becomes!**

## Features (v1.0.0)
- **Block Breaking = Explosion**: Breaking any block triggers a configurable TNT-style blast.
- **Mob Hit = Explosion**: Hitting or killing any mob (even players!) explodes at their feet.
- **Item Pickup = Explosion**: Picking up items goes boom.
- **Explosive Drops**: Dropped items have a chance to explode.

## Config
Edit `config/instaboom-config.json` to enable/disable triggers, change explosion strength, and more.
